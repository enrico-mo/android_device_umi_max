How to launch the CM13 build:
Download vendor and device from my git.
Create dirs umi/MAX and place them in working_dir/device and in working_dir/vendor
After copy files from downloaded device in working_dir/device , and from downloaded vendor in working_dir/vendor
Open terminal and write:
cd Working_dir
